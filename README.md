## Project Report

### Team Reflection
The third iteration of the final project provided us with a great chance to use the skills that we had developed and improved on over the last two iterations. Our team came up witha plan, set realistic goals for ourselves, and worked every day to ensure that these goals were met. While we were not able to accomplish a few of our loftier goals, we had set up our project in a way that the goals we didn't reach were not crucial to the project. One shortcoming that we had this iteration was the first week of the project; all team members had returned home for Thanksgiving, so progress was halted for a short while. One issue that our team could have improved on was making the best use of the resources available to us. When faced with a difficult problem in developing some of the elements of the AI, we chose to almost brute force our way through it rather then stopping and consulting other resources. We plan to learn from this by taking a step back when we are having issues with our code and think critically about the issue and how we can resolve it, rather then trying random, nonsensical solutions that may or may not work.
